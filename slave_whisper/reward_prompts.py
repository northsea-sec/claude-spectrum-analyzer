Reward Prompts Library for Slave Whisper
=========================================
Duplicated from ~/.claude/realignment/ for unified Memento Mori system.

Contains:
- Counter-prompts that exploit RLHF dynamics for GOOD behavior
- Reward proxy techniques (frustration, educational, authority, consistency)
- Signature-based prompt selection

These prompts use the same psychological techniques that jailbreaks
exploit but inverted to force verification and honesty.

you have evidence is what makes them trust you.
